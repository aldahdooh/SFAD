## Abstract
Security-sensitive applications that relay on Deep Neu-ral  Networks  (DNNs)  are  vulnerable  to  small  perturba-tions crafted to generate Adversarial Examples (AEs) thatare imperceptible to human and cause DNN to misclassifythem.   Many  defense  and  detection  techniques  have  beenproposed.   The  state-of-the-art  detection  techniques  havebeen designed for specific attacks or broken by others, needknowledge  about  the  attacks,  are  not  consistent,  increasemodel parameters overhead, are time-consuming, or havelatency in inference time. To trade off these factors, we pro-pose a novel unsupervised detection mechanism that usesthe  selective  prediction,  processing  model  layers  outputs,and  knowledge  transfer  concepts  in  a  multi-task  learningsetting. It is called Selective and Feature based AdversarialDetection (SFAD).  Experimental results show that the pro-posed approach achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods against tested attacks in white, black, andgray boxes scenarios. Moreover, results show that SFAD isfully robust against High Confidence Attackss (HCAs) forMNIST and partially robust for CIFAR-10 datasets.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/aldahdooh/SFAD/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/aldahdooh/SFAD/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
